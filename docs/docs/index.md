## Overview

PDES-MAS is a framework and a distributed simulation engine for multi Agent-based system models (MAS). PDES-MAS represents research efforts and investments of almost 20 years.  PDES-MAS has been a pioneering system that has made innovative contributions along different strands:

1. **Distributed Simulation of MAS:** PDES-MAS was one of the earliest efforts to address the problem of distributed simulation of MAS models and develop a generic distributed simulation engine specific for MAS. 
2. **Event-Driven Simulation of Agents:** Contrary to the vast majority of the simulation engines for agent models that are time-driven, PDES-MAS supports a purely event-driven modelling approach.  
3. **Optimistic Synchronisation for MAS.** PDES-MAS has been the first system to investigate optimistic synchronisation for MAS distributed simulations.
4. **Data-Centric Simulation, Linking Models to Data:** PDES-MAS has demonstrated a method for accessing data from within a simulation using different forms of queries. It has been the first to address the problem of synchronised range queries. 
5. **Space-Time Memory:** PDES-MAS implements a synchronised Distributed Shared Memory approach for state distribution and access. Contrary to most systems that utilise proxies and push methods for consistency, PDES-MAS proposes a pull approach without the use of proxies. 
6. **Distributed Virtual Environments:** PDES-MAS has been the first one to address the problems of state partition, interest management and synchronisation in an integrated, adaptive and fully transparent manner.
